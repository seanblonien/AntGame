# For the Queen!

This game was made at the Chillenium 2019 Game Jam by Alsten Okpisz, Ivan Ko, JR Diehl, and Sean Blonien using Unity 2019.2.6f1.

## Overview

All for one and one for all! You control two ants, one with each joystick, in an attempt to secure tasty treats for your queen. Have fun on your adventure! Keep an eye out for some white squares with purple markings on them, those are the sugar packet treasures you're looking for! (Hint, check the game screenshots!) When you find them, drag them back to your ant hill home by latching two ants onto the packet and head on inside!
